AfterGlow - 1.6
---------------

AfterGlow is a collection of scripts which facilitate the process of generating graphs. 
AfterGlow was written in Perl and can be used to visualize CSV files as event graphs (also called link graphs). It allwos you to read a CSV file and transforms it into a graph language file that can be read by the AT&T graphviz library to then generate an image.

PreRequisites
-------------

For AfterGlow you will need the AT&T Graphviz library installed:

History
-------

- AfterGlow 2.0 was a quick detour to help users generate treemaps. That was abandoned a long time ago.
- May 2012: I removed all the loganalysis scripts, the data directory, and moved the afterglow source up a few directories. Much cleaner. The old stuff can be found on afterglow.sf.net, browse the source and you will find the old parsers and loganalysis scripts.
