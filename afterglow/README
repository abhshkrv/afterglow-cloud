AfterGlow - 1.6
---------------

AfterGlow is a collection of scripts which facilitate the process of generating graphs. 
AfterGlow 1.x was written in Perl and can be used to visualize CSV files as event graphs (also called link graphs). AfterGlow 2.0 and later is written in Java. It can be used to visualize the same CSV files as TreeMaps. Future versions will merge the two versions and allow the generation of event graphs with the Java version as well. 
AfterGlow 1.x is reading a CSV file and transforms it into a graph language file that can be read by the AT&T graphviz library to then generate an image.
AfterGlow 2.0 is DEPRECATED! No more supported. Dead. Sorry!
AfterGlow 2.0 is utilizing the infovis graphing libraries as a basis.

As a bonus, a tcpdump and sendmail log parser is includedn in the AfterGlow distro. This will allow you to visualize network traffic and email logs right away!
